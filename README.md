This project was started fall semester of 2022 by Zac Christensen. During the spring semester of 2023 Zac attempted to upgrade the motors to 12 volts instead of five.
While doing the upgrade he ran into connection issues and due to a lack of time the project upgrade was left incoplete.
In the 2023 Fall semester I (Justin Bell) completed the 12 volt upgrade.

If someone else wishes to expand upon this project and need some ideas:
~the trax are very high friction, fix it.
~the top board can be brought closer to the bottom board for a tank body to be made.
~a turret can be added, RC maybe? integrate the light turret maybe?
~a piston located on the bottom of the unit to lift the unit off of the ground to make working and testing the unit easier
